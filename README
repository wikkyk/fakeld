A quick and dirty hack that wraps the glibc ld.so. It helps you run
binaries dynamically linked against glibc if your system libc is
something else, e.g. musl.

This should make it a bit less annoying to work around idiotic
upstreams and distributions that want you to run random blobs.

Of course you still need glibc and all the runtime dependencies
installed. On Gentoo, use crossdev to build the appropriate toolchain
(e.g. crossdev -t x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) and install any extra
dependencies into the crossdev prefix. Then, update the config.h file
and the Makefile to reflect your config and build fakeld.

A better build system is planned.
